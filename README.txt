1. I got the gif and mp3 working properly. I was able to successfully link omfgdogs.com to the page and get the link to float on the right hand side. 
I was only able to get the link to be a relative hight from the top of the page I could not make it "float" off of the bottom. 

2. For this lab I worked with Stephan Lenoach and we did not realize when it was due. We thought it was due a week from when it was assigned but then Stephan double checked and we were wrong. 

3. I spent two hours on this lab
